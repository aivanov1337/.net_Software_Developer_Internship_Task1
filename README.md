# .net_Software_Developer_Internship_Task1

An internship task where there is a RESTful web service that interacts with a database, and a web application that consumes that web service.

To run, clone the repository, open with Visual Studio, and restore nuget packages. Set the two projects as startup projects, if they are not already. If there is a Server Error during runtime, run 
"Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r" in the Package Manager console.
