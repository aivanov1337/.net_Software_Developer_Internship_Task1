Web_Service1 is a template .NET Web API project with
a default scaffolded controller using EF(entity framework).

Web_Application26034863 is a standard template .NET MVC
project, with a scaffolded EF controller with automatically
generated views. However, I changed the methods of the 
controller to instead make the appropriate HTTP calls
to Web_Service1.

I realise there is a lot of code redundancy in 
Web_Application26034863's PeopleController, but please
excuse me because I was short on time.
